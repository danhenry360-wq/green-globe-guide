import { Link } from "react-router-dom";























































































































































































































I don't see where this Canon City link should be added in the Navigation component you provided. The code you've shown is a navigation bar with main menu items like Home, USA Guide, World Guide, etc., but there's no submenu or dropdown structure where city-specific links would typically go.

The suggested edit appears to be for adding a city link, which would likely belong in a different component - perhaps a dropdown menu under "USA Guide" or in a separate cities listing component.

Could you clarify:
1. Where exactly should the Canon City link be added in this navigation?
2. Is there supposed to be a dropdown or submenu under one of the existing navigation items?
3. Or should this be added to a different component that you haven't shown yet?

Without more context about where this link should appear in the navigation structure, I cannot properly apply the edit to the code you've provided.
